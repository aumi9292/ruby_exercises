#given a string, parse the word problem out of it and return an integer that is the answer
#algorithm 
#initialize a method or structure that holds {'plus' => '+', 'minus' => '-', 'multiplied'=> '*', 'divided' => '-'}
#separate the sentence into an array of words [what, is, 1, plus, 1]
#read through each word in the sentence
  #if the string converted to an integer and then converted back to a string is equal to the original string, store the number as the first operand and second operand 
  #if the string matches any of the operators, store the appropriate operator 1.send('+', 1)
  #do the math problem 

#test implications 
#define a WordProblem class to take a question 
#define an #answer method that returns the integer answer
